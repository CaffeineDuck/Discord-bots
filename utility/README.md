## Some utility scripts to use after your bot has been deployed
_Just keep your bot token in .env file and run any of the scripts to get started_

### notice.py
- Send notice to all the channels to all the channel that has subscribed to our bot. (hook.txt, which contains the list of webhooks of the channels, must be in same directory as notice.py)

### monitor.py
- This scripts show how many guilds your bot is in, along with the guild name and guild id 

_To see how many has subscribed to your bot, just check the line count of hook.txt generated by your bot in the server it is hosted_

### sneak.py
_Diclaimer: This is strictly prohibited and is considered to be illegal and even punishable by law in some cases. I am just mentioning this for educational purpose. I am not responsible for any of your actions_ <br>
- Read messages of all the guilds your bot is in

_For this script to work, the bot must be given required permission while adding to the server. The permission includes manage messages; administration permission would be great_
