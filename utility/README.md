## Some utility scripts to use after your bot has been deployed
_Just keep your bot token in .env file and run any of the scripts to get started_

### monitor.py
- This scripts show how many guilds your bot is in, along with the guild name and guild id and its channel and members list.

### sneak.py
_Diclaimer: This is strictly prohibited and is considered to be illegal and even punishable by law in some cases. I am just mentioning this for educational purpose. I am not responsible for any of your actions_ <br>
- Read live messages of all the guilds your bot is in

### log.py
- Logs the past and present messages of all the active guilds your bot is in

_For these script to work, the bot must be given required permission while adding to the server. The permission includes send messages, read message history; administration permission would be great though_
