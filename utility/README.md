## Some utility scripts to use after your bot has been deployed
_Just keep your bot token in .env file and run any of the scripts to get started_

### monitor.py
- This scripts show how many guilds your bot is in, along with the guild name and guild id 

_To see how many has subscribed to your bot, just check the line count of hook.txt generated by your bot in the server it is hosted_

### sneak.py
_Diclaimer: This is strictly prohibited and is considered to be illegal and even punishable by law in some cases. I am just mentioning this for educational purpose. I am not responsible for any of your actions_ <br>
- Read messages of all the guilds your bot is in

_For this script to work, the bot must be given required permission while adding to the server. The permission includes manage messages; administration permission would be great_
